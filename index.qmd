This is my lab journal for the course "Business Decisions with Machine Learning".

## Overall Conclusion

The teaching content was really nicely prepared. I especially liked the videos that were used as explanations.
This helped to understand the topic even better. I have already participated in the course "Business Data Science Basics" a year ago. 
The scope was similar in this course. 
There was a lot to do and it was definitely a challenge. But I learned an incredible amount of useful stuff. 

It was very interesting. Thank you :-)
